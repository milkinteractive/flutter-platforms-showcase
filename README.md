# Flutter Platforms Showcase

This showcase demonstrates the power of the Flutter Framework. Since Flutter version 3 the code can be compiled for all major platforms.

In the [proof of concept movie](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8030398/192461025-453de576-db0a-45b1-8034-7609039014e7.mov) you see an iOS Simulator, an Android emulator, an iPad Simulator, a Linux Desktop application (top right), the macOS Desktop application (bottom left) and a Web Browser (bottom right). Windows is supported and can be tested over the [release section](https://github.com/milkinteractive/flutter-platforms-showcase/releases/).

# Get it up and running

1. [Download the Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) and go through the installation process.
2. I recommend using the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the IDE.
3. [Install the Flutter extensions for Visual Studio Code](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/vs-code)
4. Run `flutter pub get` to get the Flutter packages which are defined in the `pubspec.yaml` file.
5. Run `flutter run` to run it on a machine or device.
